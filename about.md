# About

This blog was created so I could deepen my understanding of various data science topics and tools through writing. I've always felt that my understanding of a topic has deepened when I've tried (and failed) to teach that topic to someone else. 

With that in mind, this blog will be used by me to share information and ideas on projects and tasks I've worked on. By doing this I'm hoping I can deepen my own understanding of my work.
