# About the site

This blog was created so I could deepen my understanding of various data science topics and tools through writing. I've always felt that my understanding of a topic has deepened when I've tried (and failed) to teach that topic to someone else. 

With that in mind, this blog will be used by me to share information and ideas on projects and tasks I've worked on. 

By doing this I'm hoping I can deepen the understanding of my own work. 

# About me

My background:

* I graduated from Queen's University with a B.A.Sc. in Chemical Engineering in 2016.
* I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a MASc. in Chemical Engineering in 2019.
* After graudating from Waterloo, I moved into a data science role at JANA Corporaton.

### JANA Corporation
At JANA, I use data science, machine learning and reliability engineering to predict the risk of failure of the components of our client's installed natural gas transmission and distribution asset base.

### University of Waterloo

At the University of Waterloo, I primiarily worked on:

* Developing non-linear regression tools for estimating the reaction kinetic parameters of the catalysts we were studying in the lab.
* Designing and modelling a novel membrane reactor for CO2 methanation into renewable natural gas and assessing the feasibility of a renewable natural gas production facility.

My regression and modelling work has been used in 4 [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J2R_w0UAAAAJ&hl=en).

I got interested in data science and machine learning while working on my Masters' Degree at the University of Waterloo.
