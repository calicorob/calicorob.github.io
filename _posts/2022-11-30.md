# My first deep learning model

# A brief aside
With life having been pretty crazy in 2022 (started a new job in March, bought a condo in August & moved in to said condo at the end of October) I haven't dedicated much time to independent learning and writing. As things start to settle down with the house and in life, I'm hoping I can get back to this. 

# Deep Learning
I recently started Jeremy Howard's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) as machine learning and deep learning, specifically, has interested me ever since it popped onto my radar back when I first got into the data world (~2019). 

At the time of writing this, deep learning & AI is near it's all time popularity according to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=CA&q=deep%20learning) and it seems like every new product and/or product feature has AI integrated as apart of it somehow.
