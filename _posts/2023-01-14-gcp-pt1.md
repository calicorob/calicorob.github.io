# Big Data and Machine Learning on Google Cloud Notes
The following notes are from the first section of the Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals Course.

## Introduction
* Three layers to Google Cloud infrastructure
    * Networking & Security
    * Compute & Storage
    * Big Data and ML Products

* These tasks can be accomplished without needing to manage and scale the underlying infra.

## Compute
* Compute power is needed as data needs grows.

### Compute Engine
* Similar to physical data centers. Managed the same as local centers.
* IAAS 
* Compute
* Storage
* Network

### GKE
* Containerized applications in a cloud environment. 
* Container is code packaged with all it's dependencies. 

### App Engine
* PaaS.
* Bind code to librariers.
* Focused on application logic.

### Cloud Functions
* Executes code in response to an event.
* Completely serverless.
* Free from pervisiong servers.

### Cloud Run
* Fully managed compute platform.

### Compute Uses
* Processing requirement for ML / AI is outpacing hardware's ability to produce. 
* CPU's and GPU's can no longer scale to meet the need for ML.
* Google developed the TPU which is domain specific.


## Storage
* With cloud computing, processing limitations aren't attached to stored disks.
* Most apps requires databases and stoage solution of some kind.
* Goals of these products is to reduce the time & effort needed to store data.
* Relational & non-relational available.
* Unstructured data is data stored in a non-tabular form, e.g. documents, images, audio files.
* Structured data is data stored in rows, columns.
* Cloud storage is most suited for unstructured data.

### Cloud Storage
* Standard storage (hot data), frequent access.
* Nearline storage, once per month.
* Coldline storage, once every 90 days.
* Archive storage, once a year.

### Cloud SQL
* Transactional workload.
* SQL.
* Local / regional scalability.

### Cloud Spanner
* Transactional workload.
* SQL.
* Global scalability.

### Firestone
* NoSQL.
* Transacational, document oriented.

### BigQuery
* Data warehouse.
* Analytical workload.

### BigTable
* Analytical workload.
* NoSQL.
